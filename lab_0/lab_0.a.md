## Lab Assignment

### Problem Set

Solve the following recurrence relations using the specified methods:

Note: If you choose to use code you may use C, python, or any computer language so long as you include a README.md file that explains execution. 

#### Problem 1: Telescoping Method
Solve T(n) = T(n-1) + 2n - 1, with T(1) = 1

```python
def problem1():
    """
    Students should:
    1. Expand the recurrence by telescoping or describe how they would expand a recurrence using telescoping with pseudocode. 
    2. Find the closed form (of the equation)
    3. (optional) Verify with code
    """
    # (optional) Student code here
    pass
```

#### Problem 2: Recursion Tree Method
Analyze T(n) = 3T(n/3) + nÂ² using a recursion tree

```python
def problem2():
    """
    Students should:
    1. Draw the recursion tree as a sketch and take a photo.
    2. Calculate work at each level (this can be approximated)
    3. Sum total work (work at each level summed)
    4. Determine complexity (Make your best guess)
    5. (optional) Demonstrate with Code. 
    """
    # (optional) Student code here
    pass
```
