# Demonstrations and First Lab Assignment

**This demonstration and exploration script is provided as part of an in class demonstration only.** This means you must be in class to get your environment setup to run these demos and we are not "supporting" this code beyond that scope. 

## Demo Installation 

1. Setup a python virtual environment: `python3 -m venv .venv` 
2. Activate that virtual environment: `source .venv/bin/activate` 
3. Install needed libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt` 

## Running Demos: 

You can run each python program with `python {program_name.py}`. This will provide you with some basic illustrations of telescoping, recursion, master method, and substitution method. (Full demo in class.)
